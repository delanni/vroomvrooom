# VROOMVROOM (working title)
A car game with alternative controls

# Pitch
How about a car game where you have to control the rev speed with the pitch of your voice?

# Description
The game is that classic car driving game's category by sega that EVERYONE knows but I just can't remember the name of. Players drive a car with the tilt of their heads, and speed and break with their voice, so they look like complete retards when playing. It actually only applies to adults. Kids playing this game are probably very annoying.

# Components
- Build system: setup and build the game from code to deployable product, may it be a website or a server/service
- Game physics: game's internal state, a physical model of the game and the world
- Visuals: the rendered image from the game's state
- Game mechanics: the interaction model and the game's aim
- HUD: if there should be any UI for the game
- Input: parsing the incoming voice in real time, and the head tilt, and translating it to very simple WASD

# Visual style
Outrun style looks, with fake 3d or very low-quality texed 3d rendering

# Tech
Probably yavascript ;)

Actually, typescript, what else?

# License
I guess you cannot license an idea, but the actual implementation belongs to @delanni and co. I'd call my company Monkey Business, but some idiots already took the name, so I will have to wait to get some inspiration for another good name.
